# Introducing Bolt.diy via Pinokio: Build Your Own Space Invaders Game

## What is Bolt.diy?

[Bolt.diy](https://bolt.diy) is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that enables full-stack web development directly in your browser. It’s the community-driven version of Bolt.new, allowing you to create, edit, and deploy web applications using a variety of large language models (LLMs) like OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and more. With its flexible architecture, you can integrate your preferred LLM and even extend it to support additional models via the Vercel AI SDK.[](https://thinktank.ottomator.ai/t/everything-you-need-to-get-started-with-bolt-diy/2741/29)[](https://stackblitz-labs.github.io/bolt.diy/)

Bolt.diy is perfect for developers of all levels, from beginners to experts, who want to prototype and build applications quickly without complex setup. Its browser-based environment, built on WebContainers (a WebAssembly-based Linux environment), provides a secure and efficient way to code, run, and deploy projects.[](https://www.reddit.com/r/boltnewbuilders/comments/1io5jq5/how_does_bolt_work/)

## Installing Bolt.diy with Pinokio

[Pinokio](https://pinokio.computer) is a one-click installer that simplifies the process of setting up and running server-based applications, including Bolt.diy, on your local machine. It’s an intuitive browser-like interface that eliminates the need for complex command-line installations, making it ideal for users who may struggle with traditional setup processes.[](https://pinokio.computer/)

### Steps to Install Bolt.diy via Pinokio

1. **Download and Install Pinokio**:
   - Visit [pinokio.computer](https://pinokio.computer) and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
   - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup.[](https://thinktank.ottomator.ai/t/installing-bolt-new-ottomator-using-pinokio/916)

2. **Launch Pinokio**:
   - Open the Pinokio application after installation.

3. **Access the Discover Page**:
   - Navigate to the “Discover” section in Pinokio to browse available applications.

4. **Find and Install Bolt.diy**:
   - Search for “Bolt” or “Bolt.diy” in the Discover section.
   - Click on the Bolt.diy application, select a folder name for installation, and click “Download” to install it. Pinokio will handle all dependencies and configurations.[](https://thinktank.ottomator.ai/t/installing-bolt-new-ottomator-using-pinokio/916)

5. **Run Bolt.diy**:
   - Once installed, Bolt.diy will appear on the Pinokio home screen. Click to launch it, and it will open in your browser, ready for coding.
   - If using a local LLM like Ollama, ensure the model (e.g., `qwen2.5-coder`) is downloaded and configured. You may need to edit the `app\utils\constants.ts` file to set the default model (e.g., change `DEFAULT_MODEL` to `'qwen2.5-coder'`).[](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/issues/442)

**Note**: If you encounter issues, check the Pinokio documentation or submit an issue on the [Bolt.diy GitHub repository](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy).[](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy)

## Designing Your Own Space Invaders Game with Bolt.diy

Bolt.diy’s AI-driven coding capabilities make it an excellent tool for creating games like Space Invaders, even for those with minimal coding experience. Space Invaders, a classic arcade game released in 1978, involves a player-controlled ship shooting at descending alien invaders. With Bolt.diy, you can prototype a web-based version of this game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging AI to generate and debug code.[](https://www.kodeco.com/2642-how-to-make-a-game-like-space-invaders-with-sprite-kit-tutorial-part-1)

### Why Use Bolt.diy for Game Development?

- **AI-Powered Code Generation**: Describe your game logic (e.g., “Create a player ship that moves left and right and shoots bullets at aliens”), and Bolt.diy’s LLM will generate the necessary code.
- **Browser-Based Development**: No need to install heavy IDEs or game engines; everything runs in your browser.
- **Integrated Terminal**: View real-time output of your game and debug easily with Bolt.diy’s terminal.[](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/blob/main/README.md)
- **Flexible Prototyping**: Quickly iterate on game features, such as adding sprites, collision detection, or scoring systems, with AI assistance.
- **Export and Deploy**: Download your project as a ZIP or deploy it directly to platforms like Vercel for sharing.[](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bolt-diy.mirror/)

### Steps to Create a Space Invaders Game

1. **Set Up Your Project**:
   - Launch Bolt.diy via Pinokio and start a new project.
   - Scaffold a basic web application with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For example, prompt Bolt.diy: “Create a basic HTML canvas for a 2D game with a black background.”[](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/blob/main/FAQ.md)

2. **Design the Game Logic**:
   - Use Bolt.diy to generate code for key game components:
     - **Player Ship**: Prompt: “Add a player-controlled rectangle that moves left and right using arrow keys and shoots bullets with the spacebar.”
     - **Invaders**: Prompt: “Create a grid of alien sprites that move side to side and descend over time.”
     - **Collision Detection**: Prompt: “Implement collision detection between bullets and aliens, removing aliens when hit.”
     - **Scoring and Game Over**: Prompt: “Add a score counter and a game-over screen when aliens reach the bottom.”
   - Bolt.diy will generate code snippets, which you can refine or combine. For example, use a `<canvas>` element for rendering and JavaScript for game logic.[](https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/space-invaders)

3. **Add Sprites and Animations**:
   - Upload simple sprite images (e.g., a ship and alien) to Bolt.diy or use colored rectangles for prototyping, as suggested in the Sprite Kit tutorial for Space Invaders. Prompt: “Add a sprite image for the player ship and animate it.”[](https://www.kodeco.com/2642-how-to-make-a-game-like-space-invaders-with-sprite-kit-tutorial-part-1)
   - Use CSS or JavaScript to animate invaders and bullets.

4. **Test and Debug**:
   - Run the game in Bolt.diy’s preview window to test mechanics.
   - Use the integrated terminal to view errors or logs. If issues arise, prompt Bolt.diy: “Debug why the player ship isn’t moving.”[](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/blob/main/README.md)

5. **Enhance and Deploy**:
   - Add features like sound effects, multiple levels, or mobile responsiveness by batching prompts (e.g., “Add sound effects for shooting and a mobile-friendly layout”).[](https://github.com/stackblitz-labs/bolt.diy/blob/main/FAQ.md)
   - Once satisfied, download the project as a ZIP or deploy it to a hosting platform for others to play.[](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bolt-diy.mirror/)

### Example Prompt for Bolt.diy

```markdown
Create a Space Invaders game with:
- A canvas for rendering a 2D game.
- A player ship (rectangle) that moves left/right with arrow keys and shoots bullets with the spacebar.
- A grid of 5x3 alien rectangles that move side to side and descend slowly.
- Collision detection to remove aliens when hit by bullets.
- A score display that increments when aliens are hit.
- A game-over screen when aliens reach the bottom.
Use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and keep the code simple for a beginner.
